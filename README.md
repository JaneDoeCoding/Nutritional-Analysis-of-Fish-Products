## Fish Product Nutritional Analysis Web Application

1.Project Overview

This project is a web application for nutritional analysis of fish products. Users can use the platform to look up nutritional information for different fish products, such as:

Protein content, Fat content, Dietary fiber, Other basic nutritional indicators

The project follows a front-end and back-end separated architecture. The back end is built with Python (Flask), and the front end is developed using TypeScript and React, providing a clean and intuitive interface for data querying and visualization.

2.Background 

On one hand, I have a strong interest in TypeScript and React, and I wanted to deepen my understanding of these technologies by building a complete web application from scratch. On the other hand, I took nutrition-related courses during my undergraduate studies and learned that fish products are an excellent source of nutrition, rich in high-quality protein and unsaturated fatty acids.

So I chose nutritional analysis of fish products as the theme of this project. The goal is to provide a useful tool for people who enjoy fish products or care about healthy eating.

3.Features

Query nutritional information for different fish products; Display key nutritional indicators in a clear and user-friendly interface; Front-end and back-end separation for easier maintenance and future expansion

4.Technical Architecture

Backend:

Language: Python

Framework: Flask

Responsibilities:

  	Provide APIs for fish product nutritional data
  
  	Handle data queries and responses

Location: backend/ directory


Frontend

Language: TypeScript

Framework: React

Responsibilities:

  	User interface rendering
  
  	Communication with backend APIs
  
  	Display of nutritional data

Location: frontend/ directory

Both the frontend and backend can be deployed to a cloud platform. After deployment, users can directly access the frontend page through a web browser to query nutritional information for fish products.

5.Future Improvements

Add more types of fish and seafood products; Introduce charts and visualizations for nutritional data; Improve overall UI design
